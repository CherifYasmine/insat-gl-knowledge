## What is blockchain

Blockchain is a system that records transactions that are devided into multiple blocks connected to each others where can anybody add a transaction and check if particular one exists.

- It is impossible to change information or cheat.
- Transactions are duplicated and distributed accross the network.
- Blockchain is decentrelized.
- Blockchain  is managed on a peer-to-peer network of computers, which are referred to as **nodes**. It can also be described as a distributed ledger: a decentralized way to chronologically document transactions.

## How it works

If two parties **agree to a transaction**, this information is **broadcast** to the computers (nodes) of the peer-to-peer network, where it is then **validated**. Once the transaction has been verified, it is added to a block together with other transactions. This block is then **hashed**. Every block contains a **reference to the hash** of the block that came before it. This guarantees the position of the block in the chain and ensures that it **cannot be tampered** with. The new block is then permanently added to the blockchain and **distributed to all its participants**. The transaction is now complete.

## Public, Private &  Blockchain

Both are working in the same way, the difference here who is allowed to participate.

### Public Blockchain

- Open to everyone
- Anyone could participate
- Verifying transactions takes a lot of time due to the large number of participants.
  
### Private Blockchain

- Controlled by one entity that decides who is allowed to participate. 
- This entity may also set up rules and regulations to govern transactions. 
- Transactions are generally conducted faster within a private blockchain because of the limited number of participants.
